# newsletterProject

Hello there.

The end goal of this project is to create a web-based application that allows users to input
their email address which will add it to a SQLite database. This database can then be pulled
by the site administrator to create a mailing list for a newsletter.

The code loaded as of now (06/03/2017) is a program I have created to start me down that path
as I have just begun how to program, specifically in Ruby.
